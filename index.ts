/**
 * HYTOPIA SDK Boilerplate
 *
 * This is a simple boilerplate to get started on your project.
 * It implements the bare minimum to be able to run and connect
 * to your game server and run around as the basic player entity.
 *
 * From here you can begin to implement your own game logic
 * or do whatever you want!
 *
 * You can find documentation here: https://github.com/hytopiagg/sdk/blob/main/docs/server.md
 *
 * For more in-depth examples, check out the examples folder in the SDK, or you
 * can find it directly on GitHub: https://github.com/hytopiagg/sdk/tree/main/examples/payload-game
 *
 * You can officially report bugs or request features here: https://github.com/hytopiagg/sdk/issues
 *
 * To get help, have found a bug, or want to chat with
 * other HYTOPIA devs, join our Discord server:
